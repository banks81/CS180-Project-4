# CS-180-Project-4


## How to Compile and Run:

To compile our project, ensure you have all necessary files: Market.java, User.java, Customer.java, Seller.java, Products.java, Store.java, StoreList.txt, UsersList.txt, and _______ (any other ones needed?). Then, navigate to the Market class and run that file. It contains the main method that will run the program. You should see a welcome message printed to the console. The program will give you all prompts through console printing, simply input to the program using that and you will be able to test all methods and functionality.
